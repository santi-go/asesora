1. Creating the docker files and adding it to the gitignore.

Fourth chapter: launch the app in the local staging environment
${RESET}
1. Rising the local staging with the docker environment.
   Wait a moment and type 'localhost:80' in the browser.
   At this time you can use the app.
   When you have finished trying the app you have two options:
   - Use 'Ctrl+c' and break the process. So you can make corrections
     in the dockerfile file and manually raise the environment again
     as many times as you want.
     Type 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.local-staging.yml up --build'
     to build and run again.
     Then you must use 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.local-staging.yml exec asesora bash'
     to enter in container.
     If you need the changes, remember to copy them to another file to apply later to the server.
   - Or continue the process of this script. By continue the process all changes are destroyed.
2. Down the local staging environment.
